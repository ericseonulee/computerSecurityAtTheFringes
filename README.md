# Cryptographic Attacks

# Introduction
  Investigate vulnerabilities in widely used cryptographic hash functions including length-extension attacks and collision vulnerabilities.
  In Part 1, I will attack the authentication capability of an imaginary server API.
  The attack will exploit the length-extension vulnerability of hash functions in the MD5 and SHA family.
  In Part 2, I will use a cutting-edge tool to generate different messages with the same MD5 hash value (collisions).
  I'll then investigate how that capability can be exploited to conceal malicious behavior in software.
